# GOOD

* Clean separation between components
* Nice "interface" for specifying AI players
* Easily "injectable" functions for rendering and announcing

# TO BE IMPROVED

* Still not quite sure how best to specify the position of a battleship
* Still not quite sure about the relationship between a Player and a GameBoard
* Missing a lot of error validation (eg. what if you shoot somewhere you've already shot?)

# PROCESS

* Start simple
* Don't write code to solve problems you don't have yet
* Think carefully about what each part of your code is "responsible" for. Where possible, don't blur the lines
* Leave yourself flexibility to change your mind
